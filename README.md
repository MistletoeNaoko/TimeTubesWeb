TimeTubes Web
====
**For now, clustering funcions work only on local.**

## Introduction
TimeTubes Web is a web-based visualization tool for **BLAZAR** observation data. 
It visualized observation time stamp and 6 variables simultaneously. It is helpful for astronomers to analyze time variations of and correlations among intensity, polarization, and color of the light from blazars. 

It supports visual comparison of multiple datasets, feature extractions, etc.

## Requirement
Currently, TimeTubes Web does not operate smoothly on Google Chrome (you can use Google Chrome, but it takes a little long time to render a tube). I highly recommend to use Firefox.

## Install
To run TimeTubes Web from its source code, run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
